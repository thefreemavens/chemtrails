## The Free Mavens welcome free-thinkers and truth-seekers from every discipline and culture who search for a deeper understanding of the world.

**We’re in early-beta and invite-only stage.**

This means it will take more time and effort from the community before we can really push our main goals forward to wider audiences. For now, we are focusing on assuring high quality of content and the growth of The Free Mavens community.

> At this early stage, our goal is to build a strong core team of Mavens with a positive and can-do attitude.

**Remember:** The Free Mavens is not for everyone. Our community consists of free, open minded and truth seekers with a shared goal that is inline with both the [Mavenry]({{ site.baseurl }}/mavenry/) ideology and [What we stand for]({{ site.baseurl }}/mission/). Please take a short read and decide if *Freemavenry* is for you.

We welcome individuals that can help The Free Mavens community in [areas of expertise]({{ site.baseurl }}/community/areas-of-expertise/) where they shine the most.

If you are a technologist, designer, content-creator, service-provider, or a scientist then we need your help and encourage you to join. We also don’t say no to a helping hand, so if you believe you can contribute in areas we have yet to list, we encourage you to join as well.

Lastly, if you consider yourself an early adopter, or want to stay informed, learn more, and help us with research on topics that matter, then you too will be welcomed.
