<h2 class="tfm-sub-head"> The Free Mavens is a research-based collaborative community. We believe passionately in the power of unity and knowledge to change behaviors, lives, and ultimately, the world.</h2>

We provide a platform for researchers, free-thinkers and truth seekers, so that people all around the globe can gain a better understanding of the biggest issues faced by the world, and feed a desire to unite and help create a better future for all of us. Core to this goal is a belief that there is no greater force for changing the world than the power of knowledge.

> With knowledge comes power, and with power comes great responsibility.

The Free Mavens aim to make great knowledge accessible to all while promoting critical and free thinking. In fact, everything we do is driven by this goal: How can we best spread knowledge and spark collective awakening?

Weâ€™re devoted to spreading knowledge, usually in the form of short, powerful studies, and dedicated web applications and videos. We begin with this website, setting the first milestone for a challenging journey ahead of us.
