<h2> The Free Mavens roots is in the search for truth. We were born of an impossible vision: that with free thinking, unity, and great knowledge, we can make a difference and change the world.</h2>

As we enter a new era of how we process information, we believe that the Free Mavens’ vision is more important than ever.

The world is a very different place now than a few years ago. The internet is less open and more censored. Privacy is increasingly rare. Sources of information are more fragmented and not always reliable. The window of public discourse is narrowing worldwide. These changes challenge our vision and the Free Mavens will fiercely defend against them. But —

> The world is also changing for the good, and in ways that make it more possible for us to achieve our vision.

Literacy is rising globally. Access to the internet, often via mobile devices, is less expensive than it has ever been. More people are connected than ever before. Advances in technology are making free knowledge ever more accessible and The Free Mavens community of global volunteers is growing—introducing new voices, generations, and perspectives.

This is good news for our mission. This is good news for all of us.
