      <div class="collapsein">
        <p>Ultimately, The Free Mavens aim to make great knowledge accessible to all while promoting critical and free thinking. In fact, everything we do is driven by this goal: <b>How can we best spread knowledge and spark collective awakening?</b></p>
        <p>We provide a platform for researchers, free-thinkers and truth seekers, so that people all around the world can gain a better understanding of the biggest issues faced by the world, and feed a desire to unite and help create a better future for all of us. Core to this goal is a belief that there is no greater force for changing the world than the power of knowledge.</p>
        <p>We’re devoted to spreading knowledge, usually in the form of short, powerful studies, and dedicated interactive applications and videos. We begin with this website, setting the first milestone for a challenging journey ahead of us.</p>

        <p><b>We’re in early-beta and invite-only stage.</b> This means it will take more time and effort from the community before we can really push our main goals forward to wider audiences. For now, we are focusing on building a strong core team of Mavens with a positive and can-do attitude while assuring high quality of content and the growth of The Free Mavens community.</p>

        <p><b>The Free Mavens is not for everyone.</b> Our community consists of free, open minded and truth seekers with a shared goal that is inline with both the Mavenry ideology and what we stand for. Please read this section in completion and decide if joining The Free Mavens is right for you. We welcome individuals that can help The Free Mavens community in areas of expertise where they shine the most.</p>
        <p>If you are a researcher, technologist, designer, content-creator, service-provider, or a scientist then we need your help and encourage you to join. We also don’t say no to a helping hand, so if you believe you can contribute in areas we have yet to list, we encourage you to join as well.</p>
        <p>Lastly, if you consider yourself an early adopter, or want to stay informed, learn more, and help us with research on topics that matter, then you are welcome too.</p>
